# practice-game
This practice game with stolen assets is a game like Galaga. However, the game works the following way:
- You kill enemies
- You get gold out of them
- You upgrade your ship
- You get gold easier out of the enemies
- You upgrade the ENEMIES (not implemented)
- You get MORE gold out of them
- You kill a final ship with your upgraded ship (not implemented)

It's a different way to play the game. It features a shop, and the game itself. Again, none of the images or art were mine except for some tweaks I did in Photoshop to adjust them to the theme of the game. Not even the font is mine! (silkscreen)
